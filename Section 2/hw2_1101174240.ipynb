    "Scikit-Learn is a library of Python was developed David Cournapeau in 2007. There are 3 features on scikit-learn such as Classification, Regression, Clustering\n",
    "2. What is Classification? Explain with Applications and Algorithms.\n",
    "Classification is one of features of Scikit-learn. Scikit-Learn provides easy access to numerous different classification algorithms. Among these classifiers are:\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "- Decision Tree Classifiers/Random Forests\n",
    "- Naive Bayes\n",
    "- Linear Discriminant Analysis\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "3. What is Regression? Explain with Applications and Algorithms. \n",
    "Regression is one of features of scikit-learn which predict a continous valued attribute associated with an object. There are several algorithms for regression such as Linear Regression and Logistic Regression\n",
    "4. What is Clustering? Explain with Applications and Algorithms. \n",
    "  Clustering are automatic grouping of same or similar objects into sets. The applications of clustering are customer segmentation and grouping experiment outcomes. k-Means, spectral clustering, and mean-shift are some of the algorithms used in clustering."
